           <p className="">Growing up in the rolling Tuscan countryside among the olive trees, my surroundings have always been nature, craftsmen, the simple life and people with passion. It might seem to you that living in a village with 350 people could be boring or uninspiring. I am not a bright lights, big city kind of guy. Nature, the smells of the past, my childhood, all the stories surrounding me inspire me. Luckily my wife too has fallen in love with life here in the countryside.</p>

          <p>How we work together? It is simple - we just do. It feels like the most natural thing in the world. We fit. It just flows. I couldn’t imagine working without Samina. She is a huge part of the success of the brand Andrea Brugi. We are always tweaking the design of our cutting boards. Our olivewood cutting boards are made from local 400-1000 year old Tuscan olive trees and have become a bit iconic of our trademark. The trees are protected and only felled when they no longer bear fruit. We use the same olive wood for our handmade spoons, plates, salt-cellars, etc. I like to keep it simple.

           I guess my passion for wood began when I was a little boy. I grew up surrounded by olive groves. We lived on the edge of an ancient hilltop village where I used to tag along with my father, who was an electrician, when he went to help some of the old villagers. This is how I fell in love with old houses, how they were constructed, all the little quirks that came with using the materials that were to hand – also when they were repaired over the centuries.</p>

          I think our success has something to do with a kind of fusion that happens with my Danish wife. Samina definitely has a great influence on my work. Her Scandinavian sense of streamlined aesthetics together with my organic, rustic roots is our ‘secret sauce’.

I love old tools. In general I love old traditions, and objects with a story. I am also very fascinated by how older wooden pieces are constructed, by old traditions such as tongue and groove joints, which I use for my dining tables. Our latest design for the cutting boards for example is with wooden biscuits, another old technique that has inspired me to do what I am doing today.</p> </div>
